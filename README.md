## ✨ Features

### 🎯 Tax-Efficient Asset Location
Automatically optimize which assets go in which accounts (taxable, traditional IRA, Roth IRA) to minimize your tax burden. Balanced understands:
- Bonds prefer tax-deferred accounts (ordinary income)
- Stocks prefer taxable accounts (qualified dividends, long-term capital gains)
- High-growth assets prefer Roth accounts (tax-free growth)

### 📊 Smart Rebalancing Strategies
Choose from three rebalancing philosophies:
- **Strict/Calendar**: Rebalance on any deviation (best for tax-advantaged accounts)
- **Drift Bands (5/25 Rule)**: Only rebalance when drift exceeds thresholds (reduces unnecessary trading)
- **Inflow Only**: Never sell, only use new contributions (perfect for taxable accounts)

### 🛡️ Privacy-Focused
Your financial data **never leaves your device**. Everything is stored locally in your browser using localStorage. No servers, no tracking, no data collection.

### 💰 Emergency Fund Management
Track your emergency fund separately from your investment portfolio with flexible fund-level and account-level marking.

### 🎨 Beautiful, Modern UI
- Dark mode support
- Responsive design (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- Interactive charts and visualizations
- Guided product tour for new users

### 🔧 Advanced Features
- Multiple tax strategies (Standard, Roth Growth, Mirrored)
- Customizable equity allocation with 20+ asset classes
- Bond glide path strategies (Target Date, Aggressive, Moderate, Conservative)
- CSV import for quick portfolio setup
- Export/import backup functionality

### Tax-Efficient Asset Location
Balanced implements research-backed strategies for placing assets in the right account types:
- **Taxable accounts**: Tax-efficient equity index funds (qualified dividends, long-term capital gains)
- **Traditional IRA/401(k)**: Bonds and REITs (ordinary income shielded from taxes)
- **Roth IRA**: High-growth stocks (tax-free growth forever)

### Drift Band Rebalancing (5/25 Rule)
Instead of rebalancing on every deviation, Balanced uses the 5/25 rule:
- **5% absolute drift** for major assets (≥20% of portfolio)
- **25% relative drift** for minor assets (<20% of portfolio)

This reduces unnecessary trading while keeping your portfolio on track.

### Roth Growth Strategy
Maximize tax-free growth by prioritizing high-growth equities in Roth accounts and bonds in traditional accounts.
